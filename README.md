MagicMirror
===========
This is a fork from https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror.

Major changes are:

  config.js - Modify to change weather parameters for api.forecast.io
  
  config.js - added new compliments and changed news to cnn.

  weather.js - Modified to use forecast.io

To get the weather to display on the localhost using Chromium, you need to edit the startup to include the --disable-web-security cli switch.
